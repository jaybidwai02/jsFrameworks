ES6 statnds for ECMA script 6
es6 is 100% backword compatible to es5

es6 introduces 
1.Better syntax for features that already exist
2.New functionality
3.Completely new features


let and Const
1.in es5 variables are in function scope there is no built in concept of block scope in es5 and there is noway to decleare const in es5
to overcome this es6 introduces let and const keywords

var hoisting - 
	as soon as variable scope statrt variable are assigned to undefined in es5 thats how var achive hoisting in es5

	but let and const does not support hoisting, this not disadvantage it is introduce to achive best coding practice

	Modules-
	1.each module contain pice of code that executes only once when it's loaded ie. module are sigelton
	2.module may contain variable decleration, by default declearation are local to module 
	3. if you want to decleare decleration in module golbal you have to export it so that other module can use it

	why?
	goals
	1.Default exports are favored
	2.Static module structure
	3.Support for both synchronous and asynchronous loading
	4.Support for cyclic dependencies between modules
