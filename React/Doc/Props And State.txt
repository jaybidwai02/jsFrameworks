• Props are a component’s configuration. They are received from above and
immutable as far as the component receiving them is concerned.

• State starts with a default value defined in the component’s constructor and then
suffers from mutations in time (mostly generated from user events). A component
manages its own state internally, and every time the state changes, the component is
rendered again.

container component

worth noting that you should avoid adding data fetching logic to a component that already has other
responsibilities. A good practice, instead, is to create a new stateful component whose single responsibility
is communicating with the remote API, and passing data and callbacks down as props. Some people call this
type of component a container component.
