Prop Validation

When creating components, remember that they can be composed into bigger components and reused
(in the same project, in other projects, by other developers). Therefore, it is a good practice to make explicit
in your components which props can be used, which ones are required, and which types of values they
accept. This can be done by declaring propTypes. propTypes help document your components, which
benefits future development in two ways.
1. You can easily open up a component and check which props are required and
what type they should be.
2. When things get messed up, React will give you an error message in the console, saying
which props are wrong/missing and the render method that caused the problem.

Default Prop Values
You can also provide a default prop value in case none is provided. The syntax is similar: define a
defaultProps object as a constructor property.
